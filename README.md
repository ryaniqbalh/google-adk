# Google ADK Learning Repository

This repository contains my personal notes, experiments, and code practice 
while learning Google ADK development.  

Most of the examples here are based on the YouTube tutorials by [Creator/Channel Name].  
All materials are used strictly for learning purposes, and I do not claim ownership 
of the original code or concepts.

My goal with this repository is to document my learning progress and 
build a personal reference for future development.
